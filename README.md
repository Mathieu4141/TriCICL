## Install 

### Poetry

[pypoetry doc](https://python-poetry.org/) is very well written and detailed.

*First, be sure to not be in a virtual env.*

To install poetry with the right version :
`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | POETRY_VERSION=1.1.6 python`

By default, poetry will create a virtualenv in a [cache-dir folder](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#cache-dir-string). To have it created in the repository, under a `.venv` folder, you need to first run `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` (https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#virtualenvsin-project-boolean).
Then go to our repository, and run `poetry install`. It will create a virtualenv that can be used in PyCharm, with all the dependencies needed.
